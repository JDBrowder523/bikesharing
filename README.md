# bikesharing

## Overview

 The purpose of this analysis is to determine the feasibility of starting a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. Data from the month of August of Citi Bike in New York City was analyzed using Tableau in order to better visualize and understand the bike trips and the customers that are using the service.  The data was sorted in multiple different ways in order to get an idea of what to expect if the service was started in Des Moines.

## Results

 A line graph of trip duration shows that most rides are short in duration with the majority of rides being under 10 minutes long.

 The duration graph was broken down to show the duration by gender to show that the majority of riders are male.

 A pie chart was used to show the distribution of riders of each gender which reinforces the fact that the majority of riders are male.

 A heat map was used to display the time of day that most trips occur.  Most of the trips during weekdays occur during the morning and evening.  This shows that most users are using the bikes for their morning and evening commutes.  During the weekends, the heat map shows that users are using bikes more evenly throughout the day.

 The heat map was edited to show how different genders used bikes through the day.  The heat map show's that males and females are both using the bikes primarily for their morning and evening commutes on weekdays.

 In order to better display the times when most riders are using Citi Bike, a bar graph is was used to show the most used times.  The bar graph reinforces the view that most rides occur during the morning and evening.  This graph is not filtered by day of the week, however, so it shows a more equal distribution than the heat maps above.

 The ride data was sorted into two categories: one time customers and subscribers.  The graph below shows that more one time customers use the bike service on weekends while the subscribers use the bike service more during the weekdays.

## Summary

 Citi Bikes are primarily used my males and also by commuters going to and from work.  Most trips are very short in duration, so the service will work best in highly populated areas where there is a mixture of residential housing and businesses.  The service is feasible in Des Moines but should be concentrated in the downtown areas, where residents can use the bikes to commute to and from work.

 To better understand if the Citi Bike model would work in Des Moines, a breakdown of the most highly populated areas in Des Moines should be included.  Also, data on the average commute times of Des Moines citizens could be displayed in a bar graph to better visualize the areas of the city to concentrate the most number of bikes.
